In MATLAB, image processing can be performed using various built-in functions and libraries. This allows you to manipulate and analyze images to extract useful information or enhance their visual quality. Let's explore some basic image processing tasks using MATLAB.

## Reading and Displaying an Image

To start, you need to read an image file and display it on the screen. MATLAB provides the `imread` and `imshow` functions for this purpose:

```matlab
% Read and display an image
image = imread('path/to/image.jpg');
imshow(image);
```
**Applying Filters**
One common image processing operation is applying filters to enhance or modify an image. MATLAB offers a range of filter functions, such as imfilter and fspecial, which allow you to apply various filters like blurring, sharpening, or edge detection:
```matlab
% Applying a Gaussian blur filter
filteredImage = imfilter(image, fspecial('gaussian', [5 5], 2));
imshow(filteredImage);
```
** Segmentation **
Segmentation involves dividing an image into regions or objects of interest. MATLAB provides several segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding, region growing, and clustering. Here's an example of threshold-based image segmentation:
```matlab
% Threshold-based image segmentation
threshold = graythresh(image);
binaryImage = imbinarize(image, threshold);
imshow(binaryImage);
```
** Repository with Code and Class **
For more advanced image processing tasks and algorithms, you can explore external repositories and libraries. One such repository that provides comprehensive image processing code and a class in MATLAB is the ImageProcessingToolbox repository:

Repository link: ImageProcessingToolbox
Code examples: The repository contains numerous code examples covering various image processing techniques and applications.
Class implementation: The repository also includes a well-documented ImageProcessor class that encapsulates common image processing operations.
Feel free to check out the repository for detailed code samples and utilize the ImageProcessor class to simplify your image processing workflows in MATLAB.
** Conclusion **
MATLAB offers a wide range of built-in functions and libraries for image processing tasks. By leveraging these tools and exploring external repositories, you can perform advanced image processing operations efficiently and effectively.
